# Service Discovery and Load Balancing with Weave on Amazon's ECS #

## What you will build ##

Weave allows you to focus on developing your application, rather than your
infrastructure.

In this example you will be using Weave for service discovery and load balancing
between [containers on ECS](http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/).

You will use two type of containerized microservices: HTTP Servers and Data
Producers.

Unsurprisingly, the HTTP Servers will serve data produced from the Data
Producers.

This is a very common pattern, whose implementation phase requires answering a
few questions, among which are:

* Service discovery: How does an HTTP Server find a Data Producer to connect to?
* Load balancing/fault tolerance: How can the HTTP Server's make uniform use of
  all the Data Producers?


Weave, making use of
[WeaveDNS](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/weavedns.html), will
automatically and transparently:

* Take care of service discovery by adding DNS A-records for your containers based on
  their names.
* Take care of load balancing by randomizing the order in DNS responses.


## What you will use ##

* [Weave](http://weave.works)
* [Docker](http://docker.com)
* [Amazon ECS](http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)

## What you will need to complete this guide ##

This getting started guide is self contained. You will use Weave, Docker and
Amazon ECS. We make use of the
[Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLI tool](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)
to manage and access AWS.  You will need to have a valid
[Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) account, and the AWS CLI setup and
configured before working through this getting started guide. Amazon provides an
extensive guide on how to setup the
[AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html).

* 15 minutes
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [AWS CLI >= 1.7.35 ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)
* [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
* An [SSH client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients) (optional)

## Getting the code ##

All of the code for this example is available on GitHub.

First, you need to clone the `weaveworks/guides` repository and move to the `aws-ecs`
directory, from which you will be working during most of this guide.

```bash
git clone http://github.com/weaveworks/guides
cd guides/aws-ecs
```

## AWS-CLI configuration ##

Make sure AWS-CLI is set to use a region where ECS is available
(`us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-northeast-1` or `ap-southeast-2` at
the time of writing this guide).

You can see AWS-CLI's  configuration with

```bash
aws configure list
```

and modify it running

```bash
aws configure
```

## Automatic setup ##

In order to set everything up automatically, just run the following command:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

You should get an output like the following:

```
Creating ECS cluster (weave-ecs-demo-cluster) .. done
Creating Security Group (weave-ecs-demo) .. Done
Creating Key Pair (weave-ecs-demo, file weave-ecs-demo-key.pem) .. done
Creating IAM role (weave-ecs-role) .. done
Creating Launch Configuration (weave-ecs-launch-configuration) .. done
Creating Auto Scaling Group (weave-ecs-demo-group) with 3 instances .. done
Waiting for instances to join the cluster (this may take a few minutes) .. done
Registering ECS Task Definition (weave-ecs-demo-task) .. done
Launching (3) tasks .. done
Waiting for tasks to start running .. done
Setup is ready!
Open your browser and go to any of these URLs:
  http://foo.region.compute.amazonaws.com
  http://bar.region.compute.amazonaws.com
  http://baz.region.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## What did just happen? ##

The automatic `setup.sh` script has:

* Created an ECS cluster named `weave-ecs-demo-cluster`
* Spawned three hosts (EC2 instances in Amazon's jargon), which are now part of
  the cluster and are based on Weave's ECS
  [AMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Machine_Image).
* Created a ECS task family definition, which describes the HTTP Server and Data Producer containers.
* Spawned three tasks, one per host, resulting in an HTTP Server and Data Producer container running in each host.

## Testing the setup ##

The three URLs at the end of `setup.sh`'s output will communicate your browser
with the HTTP Server containers. Pick one of them (or take the three of them if
you like) and open them in your browser. This is what you should see:

![httpserver's output](img/httpserver.png)

Pressing reload in your browser will cause HTTP Server to refresh its Data
Provider address list (generated randomly by `WeaveDNS`) resulting in
load-balancing between them.

## How does service discovery and load balancing work? ##

Both the HTTP Server and Data Producer containers are very simple (naive if you
may) to make easy to understand how they work.

They are implemented in a few lines of bash, mostly using Netcat.

Container `dataproducer`:

```bash
while true; do
  echo 'Hi, this is the data producer in' `hostname -i` | nc -q 0 -l -p 4540
done
```

Container `httpserver`:

```bash
sleep 7 # Wait for data producers to start
while true; do
  # Get a message from a data producer
  DATA_PRODUCER_MESSAGE=`nc dataproducer 4540`
  HTML="<html> <head> <title>Weaveworks Amazon ECS Sample App<\/title> <style>body {margin-top: 40px; background-color: #333;} <\/style> <\/head><body> <div style=color:white;text-align:center> <h1>Chosen data producer message:<\/h1> <h2>${DATA_PRODUCER_MESSAGE}<\/h2> <\/div>"
  echo "$HTML" | nc -q 0 -l -p 80
done
```

Note that, for clarity purposes, the sources above have been slightly reformatted.


![ECS and Weave Diagram](img/ecs+weave-diagram.svg)

When ECS launches a container, the call to Docker is intercepted by WeaveProxy,
which allocates an address using weave's automatic ip allocation, registers the
container in WeaveDNS and attaches it to the weave network. WeaveDNS will
register A-records based on the container's name:

* A `dataproducer` A-record for all the Data Producer containers.
* A `httpserver` A-record for all the HTTP Server container.

The Data Producer waits for requests on TCP port 4540 and responds with a string containing its IP.

The HTTP Server works as follows:

1. Contact a Data Producer and obtain its message (`nc dataproducer 4540`). This
   will implicitly do load balancing due to WeaveDNS' response randomization
   (more about it this in next section).
2. Compose some HTML with the information obtained in (1) and (2).
3. Wait for a browser to connect.


## What's happening in the hosts? ##

If you are curious about what's happening in the ECS instances, you can access
them through ssh by doing:

```
ssh -i weave-ecs-demo-key.pem ec2-user@${INSTANCE}
```

where `${INSTANCE}` can be any of your 3 instance hostnames
(`foo.region.compute.amazonaws.com`, `bar.region.compute.amazonaws.com` or
`baz.region.compute.amazonaws.com` in the `setup.sh` example listing above).

For example, you can list what containers are running in the instance:

```
[ec2-user@ip-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX ~]$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                            NAMES

```

* Container `ecs-weave-ecs-demo-task-1-httpserver-9682f3b0cd868cd60d00` is the
  HTTP Server of this host, producing the output you saw in your browser.  Note
  how container names are mangled by ECS to
  `ecs-${TASK_FAMILY_NAME}-${TASK_FAMILY_VERSION}-${STRIPPED_CONTAINER_NAME}-${UUID}`.

* Container `ecs-weave-ecs-demo-task-8-dataproducer-b8ecddb78a8fecfc3900` is the
  Data Producer of this host.

* Containers `weaveproxy` and `weave` are unsurprisingly responsible of running
  Weave in each ECS instance. For simplification, the proxy was represented out
  of Docker in previous section's diagram, but it so happens that WeaveProxy runs
  inside of Docker.

* Container `ecs-agent`, also unsurprisingly, corresponds to
  [Amazon's ECS Agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent), which runs on
  all ECS instances and starts containers on behalf of Amazon ECS. Again, for
  simplification, the ECS Agent was represented out of Docker in previous
  section's diagram.


You can see the IPs of all the HTTP Servers and Data Producers by running:

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX ~]$ export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/weave.sock # Use weave-proxy
[ec2-user@ip-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX ~]$ docker run 2opremio/weaveecsdemo dig +short httpserver
10.36.0.3
10.32.0.3
10.40.0.2
[ec2-user@ip-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX ~]$ docker run 2opremio/weaveecsdemo dig +short dataproducer
10.36.0.2
10.32.0.2
10.40.0.1
```

Running the commands above multiple times will yield to different orderings in
the output. This is because WeaveDNS randomizes the order of the IPs, which in
turn causes HTTP Servers to transparently do load balancing when connecting to
Data Producers.

### Cleanup ###

To clean everything which was created by `setup.sh` just run:

```bash
./cleanup.sh
```

## Manual Setup ##

You may want more details about how set up an ECS Cluster with Weave.
Follow these steps to manually reproduce what `./setup.sh` is doing
automatically.

### Create ECS Cluster ###

```bash
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name weave-ecs-demo-cluster
```

### Create Security Group and Key Pair ###

Create the security group `weave-ecs-demo`

```bash
SECURITY_GROUP=$(aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name weave-ecs-demo --description 'Weave ECS Demo' --query 'GroupId' --output text)
```

Add inbound rules to the group in order to allow:

* Public SSH access.
* Public HTTP access.
* Private Weave access between instances.

```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name weave-ecs-demo --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name weave-ecs-demo --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name weave-ecs-demo --protocol tcp --port 6783 --source-group weave-ecs-demo
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name weave-ecs-demo --protocol udp --port 6783 --source-group weave-ecs-demo
```

Next you create a key pair which allows us to access any EC2 instances which are associated with this security group.

```bash
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name weave-ecs-demo-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > weave-ecs-demo-key.pem
```

### IAM Role ###

Create a IAM role for the Weave ECS instances 

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name weave-ecs-role --assume-role-policy-document file://data/weave-ecs-role.json
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name weave-ecs-role --policy-name weave-ecs-policy --policy-document file://data/weave-ecs-policy.json
aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name weave-ecs-instance-profile
aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name weave-ecs-instance-profile --role-name weave-ecs-role
```

## Create Launch Configuration ##

Choose a Weave ECS AMI depending on your configured region:

* `us-east-1` -> `ami-97b86afc`
* `us-west-2` -> `ami-69d3de59`
* `eu-west-1` -> `ami-d26d25a5`
* `ap-northeast-1` -> `ami-083b8f08`
* `ap-southeast-2` -> `ami-1d80c627`


and execute the command below replacing `XXXX` with the AMI of your region.

```bash
AMI=XXXX aws autoscaling create-launch-configuration --image-id ${AMI} --launch-configuration-name weave-ecs-launch-configuration --key-name weave-ecs-demo-key --security-groups ${SECURITY_GROUP} --instance-type t2.micro --user-data file://data/set-ecs-cluster-name.sh  --iam-instance-profile weave-ecs-instance-profile --associate-public-ip-address --instance-monitoring Enabled=false
```

## Create Auto Scaling Group ##

You are going to create an Auto Scaling Group with 3 instances in the first subnet available in your region.

```bash
SUBNET=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets --query 'Subnets[0].SubnetId' --output text)
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name weave-ecs-demo-group --launch-configuration-name weave-ecs-launch-configuration --min-size 3 --max-size 3 --desired-capacity 3 --vpc-zone-identifier ${SUBNET}
```

### Register Task Definition ###

```bash
aws ecs register-task-definition --family weave-ecs-demo-task --container-definitions "$(cat data/weave-ecs-demo-containers.json)"
```


### Launch Task ###

Before launching the demo task, confirm that the 3 instances from the Auto
Scaling Group have joined the cluster. This should should happen shortly after
creating the Auto Scaling Group.

To confirm it, run the following command. The output will show `3` once all the instances are part of the cluster.

```bash
aws ecs describe-clusters --clusters weave-ecs-demo-cluster --query 'clusters[0].registeredContainerInstancesCount' --output text
```

Now, launch the demo task. You will be launching 3 task instances, one per EC2
instance in the Auto Scaling Group.

```bash
aws ecs run-task --cluster weave-ecs-demo-cluster --task-definition weave-ecs-demo-task --count 3
```

## Summary ##

You have used Weave out-of-the-box in ECS, both for service discovery and load
balancing between containers on ECS, regardless of whether the execute in the same or
different hosts.

## Known issues/limitations ##

* Auto Scaling Groups are required for ECS to work with Weave. If you create individual
  instances, they won't work be able to see each other due to how Weave finds peers in ECS.
* Due to how ECS mangles container names at launch, Weave's service discovery is
  only supported in container names with alphanumeric characters
  (e.g. `httpserver` would be OK but `http-server` wouldn't due to the hyphen)


## For the advanced user: Build your own Weave ECS AMI ##


Clone the guides repository if you haven't done so yet and go to the `packer`
directory.

```bash
git clone http://github.com/weaveworks/guides
cd guides/aws-ecs/packer
```

First, build special versions `ecs-init` and `weave`. You will need to have
Docker installed for this to work.

```bash
./build-ecs-init-weave.sh
```

Next, download a SFTP-enabled version of [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to build
the AMI.

```bash
wget https://dl.bintray.com/2opremio/generic/packer-sftp_0.8.1_linux_amd64.zip
unzip packer-sftp_0.8.1_linux_amd64.zip -d ~/bin
```

Finally, invoke `./build-all-amis.sh` to build `Weave ECS` images for all
regions. This step installs (in the image) the version of ecs-init we just
built, AWS-CLI, jq, Weave/master, init scripts for Weave and updates the ECS
agent to use WeaveProxy.

You can customize the image by modifying `template.json` to match your
requirements.

```bash
AWS_ACCSS_KEY_ID=XXXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYYY  ./build-all-amis.sh
```

This can be a lengthy process, so if you want to build an image just
for a specific region set the environment variable `ONLY_REGION` to the specific
region you want to build the image for. For instance:

```bash
ONLY_REGION=us-east-1 AWS_ACCSS_KEY_ID=XXXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYYY  ./build-all-amis.sh
```
