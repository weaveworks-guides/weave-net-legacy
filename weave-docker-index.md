Weave provides a software network optimized for visualizing and communicating with apps distributed among Docker containers. Using tools and protocols that are familiar to you, Weave's network provides a way for you to communicate between containerized apps distributed across multiple networks or hosts more quickly and efficiently.
 
 To get up and running using a Weave Network with your docker containers, see the following Getting Started Guides:
