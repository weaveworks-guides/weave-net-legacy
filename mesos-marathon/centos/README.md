In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Apache Mesos & Marathon cluster manager together with Weave Net to network Docker containers.  

You will:

1. Provision two virtual machines with [CentOS](http://centos.org/).
2. Install and launch [Docker](http://docker.com) and [Weave Net](http://weave.works)
3. Set up and configure [Apache Mesos & Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/)
4. Deploy and test a simple web app.
5. Use Weave Net for simple load balancing. 

This example requires no programming, but does assume some UNIX skills. It will take about 10 minutes to complete. 

##How Weave Net Interacts with Mesos  

[Weave Net](/net) networks containers on an isolated overlay network, and also provides DNS and IP address allocation.

Mesos Marathon frameworks implements a management API (used by `deploy_on_marathon.sh` script) and the user interface. Mesos schedules any tasks created through Marathon and runs those on the cluster, where with the exception of `mesos-00` there is a `mesos-slave` service on each of the nodes . Docker and the Weave Net containers run on all nodes, it doesn't have to run on `mesos-00`, but from a management perspective, it may be convenient to do so. 

![Architecture Overview](/images/mesos-marathon/centos/diagram-1.png)

To enable Marathon to deploy tasks as Docker containers and to use Weave Net, [a configuration file](https://github.com/weaveworks/guides/blob/master/mesos-marathon/centos/mesos-slave-containerizers.conf) [installed](https://github.com/weaveworks/guides/blob/0b10b27f0559b8852c12b81b94034823c3816777/mesos-marathon/centos/setup_and_launch_mesos_slave.sh#L7) using Vagrant's provisioning logic is provided.  See these files for further information on how this tutorial is configured.  

The following diagram shows how Weave Net interacts with Docker and Mesos.

![Weave Net, Docker and Mesos](/images/mesos-marathon/centos/diagram-2.png)

For more information on the Apache Mesos and its application manager, Marathon, refer to the [Apache Mesos Docs](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/) and the [Marathon Docs](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/).

## How This is Setup?

During the provisioning phase (`vagrant up`), several shell scripts run on Vagrant that install and configure both Weave Net and any necessary RPM packages from the Mesosphere repository. Open the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/weaveworks/guides/blob/0b10b27f0559b8852c12b81b94034823c3816777/mesos-marathon/centos/Vagrantfile#L59-L82), to see the logic of how, where and when those scripts are executed.

##Before You Begin

Please ensure the following are installed:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Vagrant & VirtualBox](/guides/about/vagrant.html)

##Setting up the VMs and Configuring Apache Zookeeper

First, clone the repo and then run the vagrant script:

~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/weaveworks/guides
cd guides/mesos-marathon/centos
vagrant up
~~~

Once Vagrant is finished running, you should have two Virtual Machines called `mesos-00` and `mesos-01` with CentOS. It should also have configured a single Apache Zookeeper instance using `mesos-00` as master, and `mesos-01` as slave within the Marathon framework. In addition to this, Docker and Weave Net is also installed.

Once Vagrant is complete, you can access the Marathon UI through your browser at: `http://172.17.85.100:8080`.

## Viewing the Weave Network on the Virtual Machines

View the Weave network on the virtual machines:

~~~ bash
vagrant ssh mesos-00
~~~

First become root.

~~~ bash
[vagrant@mesos-00 ~]$ sudo -s
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]#
~~~

View Weave status:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]# weave status
~~~

or see a more detailed status of Weave Net:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]# systemctl status weave
~~~

and then view three Docker containers and Weave Net:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]# docker ps
~~~

Where you should see the following:

    CONTAINER ID    IMAGE                        COMMAND                CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                            NAMES
    b9c179b2303d    weaveworks/weaveexec:1.4.3   "/home/weave/weavepr   4 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes                                                    weaveproxy
    3ca6d9c9dd0d    weaveworks/weave:1.4.3       "/home/weave/weaver    4 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   0.0.0.0:6783->6783/tcp, 0.0.0.0:6783->6783/udp   weave


There is not much else to do on `mesos-00`, so you can exit:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]# exit
~~~

Back in your local shell, run:

~~~ bash
./deploy_on_marathon.sh outyet.json
~~~

This script deploys a simple "Hello, World" web app, as shown in [Marathon tutorial](http://open.mesosphere.com/intro-course/ex17.html).  And in this tutorial, four instances of the web app are deployed.

###Load Balancing with Weave Net

Weave Net can also be used as a transparent, DNS-based, load-balancer, and it also eliminates the need for port remapping and instead uses a default container port.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
If you are looking to deploy your own app instead of this example, make sure to <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/guides/blob/0b10b27f0559b8852c12b81b94034823c3816777/mesos-marathon/centos/outyet.json#L12">set the <code>hostname</code> parameter</a>, otherwise your containers will fail to launch.
</div>

The Marathon UI is accessed at `http://172.17.85.100:8080`

![Marathon Apps](/images/mesos-marathon/centos/marathon-1.png)

Log on to `mesos-01`, become root and set the environment for Weave Net, which is necessary for attaching containers to a Weave network:

~~~ bash
vagrant ssh mesos-01

[vagrant@mesos-01 ~]$ sudo -s
[root@mesos-01 vagrant]# eval $(weave env)
~~~

List the container processes and confirm that there four instances of the app:

    [root@mesos-01 vagrant]# docker ps | grep outyet
    
    666a8c7f344e     docker.io/goexample/outyet:latest   "/w/w go-wrapper run   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes     8080/tcp     mesos-20150803-095152-1683296684-5050-15616-S0.bceb4f07-0ff9-4555-b9f0-99dadc9392fa
    8e708c45d0a9     docker.io/goexample/outyet:latest   "/w/w go-wrapper run   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes     8080/tcp     mesos-20150803-095152-1683296684-5050-15616-S0.a9db0ff5-f666-40be-bc99-b8ee7dac170d
    819a8c3a4f78     docker.io/goexample/outyet:latest   "/w/w go-wrapper run   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes     8080/tcp     mesos-20150803-095152-1683296684-5050-15616-S0.05f07ff3-0115-4d4b-b6e7-ce1c9532370e
    d9046f7e63cc     docker.io/goexample/outyet:latest   "/w/w go-wrapper run   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes     8080/tcp     mesos-20150803-095152-1683296684-5050-15616-S0.374e679d-edee-47ed-a3e2-69abf017a3f3


Next, test the app's functionality by making the container interactive:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-01 vagrant]# docker run -ti centos:7
[root@7844aae5d94d /]# curl outyet:8080
~~~

You should see output similar to this:

    <!DOCTYPE html><html><body><center>
            <h2>Is Go 1.4 out yet?</h2>
            <h1>
                    <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/&#43;/go1.4">YES!</a>
            </h1>
    </center></body></html>


Run `curl -v outyet:8080` several times to confirm that Weave Net is balancing the load. You will notice that the IP address for `outyet` is not always the same and instead is randomized by weavedns as it balances the load between the hosts. For more information on weavedns see [Discovering Containers with WeaveDNS](/documentation/net-1.5-weavedns).


### Overriding Default Configuration Variables

Default variables for this tutorial are specified in the `Vagrantfile`:

~~~ bash
$mesos_slaves = 1
$memory = 1024*2
$cpus = 2
$network = [172, 17, 85]
~~~


Override any of these by creating a `config.rb` file with the desired variables and then save the file to the same directory.

For example, you can grow the cluster by running:

~~~ bash
echo '$mesos_slaves = 3' > config.rb
vagrant up mesos-02 mesos-03
~~~

##Conclusions
