This example demonstrates how [WeaveDNS](/documentation/net-1.5-weavedns) automatically discovers services on a `Weave` container network.

In this example, you will:

1. Create a simple containerized web service that runs on weave-gs-01.
2. Deploy `curl` into a second container on `weave-gs-02`.
3. Use curl to query the _'Hello, Weave!'_ service from the second container on one host to another host.

This tutorial uses simple UNIX tools, and it doesn't require any programming skills.

This example requires no programming skills and will take about 15 minutes to complete.

## What You Will Use

* [Weave](http://weave.works)
* [Docker](http://docker.com)
* [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com)

##Before You Begin

Install and configure the following separately before proceeding:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Vagrant & VirtualBox](/guides/about/vagrant.html)

##Setting Up The Hosts

The code for this example is available on github. Clone the getting started repository:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/weaveworks/guides
~~~

This example uses Vagrant to set up and configure two Ubuntu hosts and install Docker. These hosts are assigned IP addresses to a [private network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private%5Fnetwork), and are named `weave-gs-01` and `weave-gs-02`.

~~~bash
cd ./guides/ubuntu-simple
vagrant up
~~~

Vagrant downloads and configures the Ubuntu images. This may take a few minutes depending on the speed of your network connection. For more information on how Vagrant works, refer to the [Vagrant documentation](http://vagrantup.com).

You may be prompted for a password when `/etc/hosts` is being updated during the Vagrant setup. You can bypass this step by pressing return.

Once the hosts are set up, check their status:

~~~bash
vagrant status
~~~

The IP addresses we use for this demo are:

~~~bash
172.17.8.101 	weave-gs-01
172.17.8.102 	weave-gs-02
~~~

##Installing Weave

Install `Weave` on to each host [using a separate terminal for each host](http://weave.works/guides/about/vagrant.html#general-usage-pattern):

~~~bash
vagrant ssh weave-gs-01
vagrant@weave-gs-01:~$ sudo -s
root@weave-gs-01:~# curl -L git.io/weave -o /usr/local/bin/weave
root@weave-gs-01:~# chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/weave
~~~

~~~bash
vagrant ssh weave-gs-02
vagrant@weave-gs-02:~$ sudo -s
root@weave-gs-01:~# curl -L git.io/weave -o /usr/local/bin/weave
root@weave-gs-01:~# chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/weave
~~~

The commands to install `Weave` are provided as part of this getting started guide, but in practice you would automate this step for each host.

##Launching Weave

Now launch `Weave` on each host and create a peer connection by passing the IP of one host to another:

On host `weave-gs-01`

~~~bash
root@weave-gs-01:~# weave launch
~~~

On host `weave-gs-02`

~~~bash
root@weave-gs-02:~# weave launch 172.17.8.101 
~~~

Your two hosts are now connected to each other, and any subsequent containers you launch with `Weave` are visible to any other containers that the `Weave` network is aware of.

To view the running `Weave` components and their peers:

~~~bash
root@weave-gs-02:~# weave status

Version: v1.1.0

       Service: router
      Protocol: weave 1..2
          Name: de:df:fc:24:72:69(weave-gs-02)
    Encryption: disabled
 PeerDiscovery: enabled
       Targets: 1
   Connections: 1 (1 established)
         Peers: 2 (with 2 established connections between them)

       Service: ipam
     Consensus: deferred
         Range: 10.32.0.0-10.47.255.255
 DefaultSubnet: 10.32.0.0/12

       Service: dns
        Domain: weave.local.
           TTL: 1
       Entries: 0

       Service: proxy
       Address: unix:///var/run/weave.sock
~~~


### What Just Happened?


At this point several `Weave` containers are running on each host. To see them, run the following command from either host:

~~~bash
root@weave-gs-01:~# docker ps
~~~

where you should see something similar to the following:

~~~bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS  
3f09ad57ee8e        weaveworks/weaveexec:v1.1.0   "/home/weave/weavepr   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes                                                                                                     weaveproxy          
78476d7404c5        weaveworks/weave:v1.1.0       "/home/weave/weaver    3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        10.1.42.1:53->53/tcp, 10.1.42.1:53->53/udp, 0.0.0.0:6783->6783/tcp, 0.0.0.0:6783->6783/udp   weave      
~~~

Your network is also peered, and can be viewed by running:  `weave status`

## Building & Deploying the _'Hello, Weave!'_ Service

Next, build an Apache webserver container image and use `Weave` to run it.

On `weave-gs-01` run

~~~bash
root@weave-gs-01:~# docker build -t php-example /vagrant
root@weave-gs-01:~# eval "$(weave env)"
root@weave-gs-01:~# docker run -d --name=hello-app php-example
~~~

You now have a running Apache server in a Docker container. `Weave` records a DNS record and also automatically gives it the name `hello-app`.

To view it:

~~~bash
root@weave-gs-01:~# docker ps
~~~

###About Container Deployment

`Weave` launched a pre-built Docker image containing an Apache webserver, named it `hello-app`, and then assigned it an IP address. The Docker image is downloaded from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

The container is registered with `Weave` and is accessible to other containers registered with `Weave` across multiple hosts.

## Creating the Client Container

Next deploy a container to `weave-gs-02` and make it available to the `hello-app` webserver, running on the first host.  A docker container at `weaveworks/guide-tools` is launched to illustrate this.

On `weave-gs-02` run:

~~~bash
root@weave-gs-02:~# eval "$(weave env)"
root@weave-gs-02:~# docker run weaveworks/guide-tools curl -s http://hello-app
~~~

JSON returns:

~~~bash
{
"message" : "Hello World",
    "date" : "2015-09-30 17:05:00"
}
~~~

##Cleaning Up The VMs

To remove the VMs you just created: 

~~~bash
vagrant destroy
~~~

##Conclusions

In this example, we deployed a simple application, that returns a message from a running Apache webserver. With `Weave`, you quickly deployed two containers to the network residing on different hosts. These containers were made discoverable using `weavedns`, so that applications within containers can communicate with one another. 

You can adapt this example and use it as a template for your own implementation. We would be very happy to hear any of your thoughts or issues via [Help and Support](http://weave.works/help/index.html).
