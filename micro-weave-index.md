Weave provides a software network optimized for visualizing and communicating with apps distributed among Docker containers. Using tools and protocols that are familiar to you, Weave's network provides a way for you to communicate between containerized apps distributed across multiple networks or hosts more quickly and efficiently.
 
The following guides demonstrate how Weave works with containerized microservices: 

* [Automatic Service Discovery with Weave Run for Dockerized Spring Apps](/guides/language/java/framework/spring/index.html)
* [Microservices with Weave, Docker and Node.js on Ubuntu](/guides/weave-microservices-docker-nodejs.html)
* [Running a load balanced Ruby on Rails app with Weave, and Docker](/guides/language/ruby/ruby-on-rails-index.html)
